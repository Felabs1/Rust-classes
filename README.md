# My Project Plans After completing my Rust Classes in Web3

Practicing with small projects is a great way to learn Rust. Here are some ideas for small projects that can help you get comfortable with Rust's syntax and features:

### 1. **Hello, World!** **Done* :pray:

Starting with the basics and creating a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This helps to get familiar with the Rust toolchain and running Rust programs.

### 2. **Simple Calculator** **Done* :star::star::star::star::star:

i created a command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
### 3. Guessing Game
This guessing game  randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

### 4. To-Do List
A simple command-line to-do list application where you can add, remove, and view tasks.

### 5. File I/O
A program that reads from and writes to a file. For example, create a text editor that allows you to save and load notes from a file.

### 6. HTTP Client
We Use the reqwest crate to create a simple HTTP client that fetches data from a given URL and displays it.

### 7. Fibonacci Sequence **Done* :star::star::star::star::star:
A program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number.
### 8. Simple Web Server
This Program uses hyper or warp crate, creating a basic web server that handles HTTP requests and serves static content.

### 9. Command-line Argument Parser
A tool that parses command-line arguments and performs actions based on the input. This can help you learn about Rust's std::env module and argument parsing libraries like clap.

### 10. Temperature Converter
A program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### 11. Basic Data Structures
Implementing  basic data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues in Rust to understand memory management and ownership concepts.

### 12. Unit Conversion Tool
A tool that converts units of measurement, such as distances, weights, and volumes.

### 13. Prime Number Checker
A program that checks if a given number is a prime number.

### 14. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.

### 15. CSV Parser
A program that reads data from a CSV file and processes it. You can use the csv crate for this task.

### 16. JSON Serialization and Deserialization
Use the serde crate to serialize and deserialize JSON data. Create a program that reads a JSON file, manipulates the data, and writes it back to a file.

### 17. Basic Chat Application
A simple chat application using sockets, where multiple clients can connect to a server and send messages to each other.

### 18. Sorting Algorithms
Implementing  different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) and compare their performance.

### 19. Game of Life
Implementing  Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, and visualize the evolution of the grid.

### 20. Rust Bindings for C Libraries
Since am comfortable with C, i will write Rust bindings for a small C library to understand Rust's Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
